A written explanation of the project and what it does
  Our projectâ€™s purpose is to make group projects easier when not together in person. It allows you to message each other, and merge your calendars together to see when the best time is to work together.
A written explanation of major problems and how they were solve
  Major problems: finding a way to show what the active friends would be with the drawback that it was not easy to show the actual active friends
  Solutions: we created the examples that would mock the way it would actually work
Future improvements
  A proper messaging system
  A better scheduling system
  A way to see active friends and projects/creating projects/assignments
